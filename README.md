# Spam-Email-Classification Overview

 The jupyter notebook can take in labeled, categorized datasets. Datasets for testing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm must be numeric data. Datasets for testing the Naive Bayes algorithm must be discrete, countable data, such as words. The KNN algorithm predicts the category of points based on the most frequent class/category of points in each point's neighborhood. The Naive bayes algorithm computes the likelihood that each predicted point is in a class.


# Main Features

- Examine differences in efficiency of KNN and Naive Bayes on various datasets
- Use a confusion matrix to analyze and compare the efficiency/effectiveness of classifiers


# Execute

- Download and run .zip file or View jupyter notebooks in Github
- For best results, run or view notebooks in order: knn.ipnyb, spam_email_preprocessing.ipnyb, naive_bayes.ipnyb
